This repository presents results of the specialization of the word equations
interpreter WECount by equations given as a benchmark for the solver Woorpje,
download [here][track01.tar.gz].
The description of the equations in the track is given [here][_first_track].

The interpreter source code is [weqs_int_bench_task.ref](weqs_int_bench_task.ref),
where the input equation is to be replaced by the one to be solved.

The equations are encoded as follows.

+ Variables are encoded as `As`, `Bs`, ...., `Xs`.
+ Letters (constant symbols) are encoded as `a`, `b`,...,`x`.

Residual programs that correspond to equations with no solutions contain
the single rule:

```
$ENTRY Go {
  (e.101) = False;
}
```

The other residual programs model graphs of all solutions of the corresponding
equations.

The paths in graphs contain the following labels:

+ `('Xs -> empty')` &mdash; variable `Xs` has the value the empty string;
+ `('Xs -> Ys Xs')` &mdash; variable `Xs` has the prefix `Ys`;
+ `('Xs -> a Xs')` &mdash; variable `Xs` starts by the letter `a`.

Say, given the path `('Xs -> a Xs')('Xs -> Ys Xs')('Xs -> empty')` it models
the solution `Xs = a Ys`.

The overall results of the verification are given in the table below.
If __'Has Solutions'__ is '!' then the equation is solvable but the timeout
occurred.

__Solutions type__ is 0 if the solutions are unions of patterns (the solution
graph is a tree); is 'regular' if the solution graph contains loops, but these
loops generate regular expressions; and is 'non-regular' if the solution graph
contains some other loops.

All the equations are classified in their reduced form. E.g. the equation
`As Bs = As As` counts as acyclic, because the two occurrences of `As` are
reduced.

Acyclic equations which are not quadratic have the sides with the empty
intersection of the variables and are linear with respect to one side.

For example, the equation `As As As = Bs a Cs` is acyclic, however it
is not quadratic.
